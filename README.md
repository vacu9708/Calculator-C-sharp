# Calculator with C#
I tried making a calculator with C# to learn basic things of C#.
There were more things to consider to make a calculator and it was harder than I thought. I realized it is not that simple to make a calculator.

# Functions
* C : clear
* del : delete
* ( ) : for higher calculation priority
* *.* : decimal point
* % : remainder calculation
* +, -, *, / : 4 fundamental arithmetic operations
* = : printing the result
